    "Abstract": "In this manuscript, we have reported an augmented reality (AR) application named, 'Eye MG AR' innovated by us, to show different anatomical/pathological parts of the eyeball pertaining to glaucoma, from multiple customized angles of the user's choice to simplify glaucoma learning and clinical counseling. It is available free of cost from the Google Play Store for Android users. Procedures ranging from a simple outpatient department procedure (yttrium aluminium garnet peripheral iridotomy) to a complex surgical technique (trabeculectomy/tube surgery) can be explained and counseled with this Android application. Also, complex structures such as the angle of the anterior chamber and optic nerve head, are constructed in advanced real-time three-dimensional (3D) high-resolution confocal images. These 3D models are useful for glaucoma neophytes' immersive learning and 3D patient counseling experiences. This tool aims to reinvent the approach to glaucoma counseling with 'Unreal Engine' software and is created in a patient-friendly approach. Incepting 3D pedagogy and counseling with AR in glaucoma with real-time and high-resolution TrueColor confocal images has never been reported in the literature according to our knowledge.",
