This study investigated the use of phantom motor execution (PME) and phantom motor imagery (PMI) facilitated by extended reality (XR) for the treatment of PLP. Both treatments used XR, but PME involved overt execution of phantom movements, relying on the decoding of motor intent using machine learning to enable real-time control in XR. In contrast, PMI involved mental rehearsal of phantom movements guided by XR. The study hypothesized that PME would be superior to PMI. A multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted in 9 outpatient clinics across 7 countries. Eighty-one participants with PLP were randomly assigned to PME or PMI training. The primary outcome was the change in PLP, measured by the Pain Rating Index, from baseline to treatment cessation. Secondary outcomes included various aspects related to PLP, such as the rate of clinically meaningful reduction in pain (CMRP; >50% pain decrease). No evidence was found for superiority of overt execution (PME) over imagery (PMI) using XR. PLP decreased by 64.5% and 68.2% in PME and PMI groups, respectively. Thirty-seven PME participants (71%) and 19 PMI participants (68%) experienced CMRP. Positive changes were recorded in all other secondary outcome differences. Pain reduction for PME was larger than previously reported. Despite our initial hypothesis not being supported, PME and PMI, aided by XR, are likely to offer meaningful PLP relief to most users. These findings merit consideration for clinical implementation.",

          "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n          <jats:p>Phantom limb pain (PLP) represents a significant challenge after amputation. This study investigated the use of phantom motor execution (PME) and phantom motor imagery (PMI) facilitated by extended reality (XR) for the treatment of PLP. Both treatments used XR, but PME involved overt execution of phantom movements, relying on the decoding of motor intent using machine learning to enable real-time control in XR. In contrast, PMI involved mental rehearsal of phantom movements guided by XR. The study hypothesized that PME would be superior to PMI. A multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted in 9 outpatient clinics across 7 countries. Eighty-one participants with PLP were randomly assigned to PME or PMI training. The primary outcome was the change in PLP, measured by the Pain Rating Index, from baseline to treatment cessation. Secondary outcomes included various aspects related to PLP, such as the rate of clinically meaningful reduction in pain (CMRP; &gt;50% pain decrease). No evidence was found for superiority of overt execution (PME) over imagery (PMI) using XR. PLP decreased by 64.5% and 68.2% in PME and PMI groups, respectively. Thirty-seven PME participants (71%) and 19 PMI participants (68%) experienced CMRP. Positive changes were recorded in all other outcomes, without group differences. Pain reduction for PME was larger than previously reported. Despite our initial hypothesis not being confirmed, PME and PMI, aided by XR, are likely to offer meaningful PLP relief to most patients. These findings merit consideration of these therapies as viable treatment options and alternatives to pharmacological treatments.</jats:p>",

This study investigated the use of phantom motor execution (PME) and phantom motor imagery (PMI) facilitated by extended reality (XR) for the treatment of PLP. Both treatments used XR, but PME involved overt execution of phantom movements, relying on the decoding of motor intent using machine learning to enable real-time control in XR. In contrast, PMI involved mental rehearsal of phantom movements guided by XR. The study hypothesized that PME would be superior to PMI. A multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted in 9 outpatient clinics across 7 countries. Eighty-one participants with PLP were randomly assigned to PME or PMI training. The primary outcome was the change in PLP, measured by the Pain Rating Index, from baseline to treatment cessation. Secondary outcomes included various aspects related to PLP, such as the rate of clinically meaningful reduction in pain (CMRP; >50% pain decrease). No evidence was found for superiority of overt execution (PME) over imagery (PMI) using XR. PLP decreased by 64.5% and 68.2% in PME and PMI groups, respectively. Thirty-seven PME participants (71%) and 19 PMI participants (68%) experienced CMRP. Positive changes were recorded in all other outcomes, without group differences. Pain reduction for PME was larger than previously reported. Despite our initial hypothesis not being confirmed, PME and PMI, aided by XR, are likely to offer meaningful PLP relief to most patients. These findings merit consideration of these therapies as viable treatment options and alternatives to pharmacological treatments.",

Recognize equivalent terms: \"RCT\" = \"Randomized controlled trial\", \"Pilot study\" = \"Feasibility pilot study\", \"Cross-sectional\" = \"Observational cross-sectional\", \"User study\" = \"User evaluation study\". When multiple study type descriptions exist, prioritize the most comprehensive version from methods over abstract. Include specific qualifiers when mentioned (e.g., \"multicenter\", \"double-blind\", \"waitlist-controlled\") as these add valuable detail. Format as brief phrase describing core study methodology, avoiding generic terms like \"study\" or \"research\" alone.\n\n2. *methodology*: ONE comprehensive sentence covering: technology + application + key technical details. Include: ALL device models, software platforms, measurement tools, statistical analyses. Capture ALL hardware components mentioned (cameras, sensors, controllers, probes, etc.). Include ALL software features (real-time feedback, data export, tracking capabilities). Mention ALL technical specifications (joint tracking numbers, frame rates, resolutions). Example: \"Microsoft HoloLens 2 with HoloAnatomy platform for 3D anatomical procedural visualization using real-time motion tracking of 25 joints with CSV data export and real-time visual feedback\".\n\n3. *sample_size*: Format: \"X participants/patients\" (use paper's exact terminology). Include TOTAL numbers if multiple groups exist. Include ALL test phases: technical tests, pilot studies, user evaluations. Example: \"25 total: 23 biomedical students + 2 clinical experts; 50 technical validation readings\".\n\n4. *population*: ALL demographic details and characteristics not captured in sample_size. Include age, profession, condition, experience, setting details. Add specific numbers when available. Include recruitment sources and inclusion/exclusion criteria.\n\n5. *primary_outcome*: Include ALL measurement tools, scales, timing, specific metrics, usability criteria (ease of use, realism, anatomical accuracy). List ALL assessment instruments used and functional scales (SUS, NASA-TLX, FES-I, MoCA, IKDC, VAS, ABC scale, WHODAS 2.0, etc.), and evaluation dimensions beyond the primary measures.. Include ALL comparison conditions and timepoints. Example: \"Patient understanding via 5-point Likert scale assessed pre/post intervention, plus SUS usability scores and NASA-TLX workload assessment\".\n\n6. *key_findings*: PRIORITIZE statistical results with practical implications. Format: \"Finding 1: [statistical data + meaning]. Finding 2: [data + context]\". Include ALL significant findings, p-values, effect sizes, accuracy rates, comparative data, accuracy measurements (sub-mm, degrees), specific understanding domains (surgical risks, operative steps, recovery), and detailed performance metrics beyond statistical significance. Present ALL questionnaire results, prototype performance, qualitative benefits. Include ALL cost factors, training requirements, implementation details. Capture ALL comparison groups and their specific results. Be comprehensive - capture complete findings picture. Include ALL technical specifications mentioned: accuracy measurements (sub-mm, degrees).\n\n7. *limitations*: Extract ALL limitations from limitation/discussion sections. Include sample size issues, technical equipment requirements, methodological, practical constraints. Mention ALL equipment needs, calibration requirements, manufacturing variability. Include ALL generalizability issues, validity concerns, implementation barriers. Capture training requirements, cost constraints, specialized equipment needs. Note real-world applicability issues and clinical implementation challenges. Don't summarize - capture complete limitation landscape.\n\nReturn as valid JSON with this EXACT structure:\n\n{\n  \"study_design\": \"string\",\n  \"methodology\": \"string\",\n  \"sample_size\": \"string\",\n  \"population\": \"string\",\n  \"primary_outcome\": \"string\",\n  \"key_findings\": \"string\",\n  \"limitations\": \"string\"\n}",
