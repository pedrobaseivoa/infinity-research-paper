    "Abstract": "(1) Background: Mixed Reality (MR) technology, such as the HoloLens, offers a novel approach to preoperative education. This study evaluates its feasibility and effectiveness in improving patient comprehension and comfort during informed consent for pancreatoduodenectomy. (2) Methods: A single-center, randomized, controlled pilot study was conducted between February and May 2023. Patients recommended for pancreatoduodenectomy were randomized into a control group receiving standard education or an intervention group using the HoloLens. Pre- and post-intervention surveys assessed patient understanding and comfort. (3) Results: Nineteen patients participated (8 HoloLens, 11 control). Both groups showed improved comprehension post-intervention, but only the HoloLens group demonstrated a statistically significant increase (Z = -2.524, p = 0.012). MR users had a greater understanding of surgical steps compared to controls, and 75% of participants in both groups reported high comfort levels with the surgery. MR integration was feasible and did not disrupt clinical workflow. (4) Conclusions: These findings suggest that MR can enhance preoperative education for complex procedures. However, limitations include the small sample size and single-center design, necessitating larger studies to confirm its broader applicability. MR-based education represents a promising tool to improve patient engagement and comprehension in surgical decision making.",
