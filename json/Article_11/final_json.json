It aims to determine if MR improves patient understanding, comfort, and comprehension during informed consent compared to traditional methods. Methods: A single center randomized controlled pilot study was conducted with patients recommended for pancreatoduodenectomy due to pancreatic mass between February and May 2023. Exclusion criteria included age under 18, lack of English fluency, or severe visual/hearing impairments. Participants completed pre- and post-intervention surveys assessing their understanding of their condition and care. The control group received standard education, while the intervention group used the HoloLens. Results: Nineteen patients participated, with eight in the HoloLens group. Both groups showed improved understanding post-intervention, but only the HoloLens group had a statistically significant increase in overall comprehension (Z= -2.524, p= 0.012). The HoloLens group also had a significant improvement in understanding surgical steps and other aspects compared to controls. High comfort levels with the planned surgery were reported by 75% of participants in both groups. Conclusions: MR technology, such as the HoloLens, can significantly enhance patient understanding and comfort in preoperative education for complex surgeries. Its integration into clinical practice was feasible and non-disruptive, suggesting broader applicability. The small sample size and single-center design limit generalizability, necessitating larger studies to confirm these findings and assess the full impact of MR on patient surgical education.",

Format: \"Finding 1: [statistical data + meaning]. Finding 2: [data + context]\". Include ALL significant findings, p-values, effect sizes, accuracy rates, comparative data, accuracy measurements (sub-mm, degrees), specific understanding domains (surgical risks, operative steps, recovery), and detailed performance metrics beyond statistical significance. Present ALL questionnaire results, prototype performance, qualitative benefits. Include ALL cost factors, training requirements, implementation details. Capture ALL comparison groups and their specific results. Be comprehensive - capture complete findings picture. Include ALL technical specifications mentioned: accuracy measurements (sub-mm, degrees).\n\n7. *limitations*: Extract ALL limitations from limitation/discussion sections.
