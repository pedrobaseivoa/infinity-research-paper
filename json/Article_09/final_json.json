For this reason, this study aims to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of utilizing a digital rehabilitation program based on computer vision and augmented reality in comparison with traditional care for patients who will undergo isolated meniscus repair, since to date, there is no literature on this topic. This study intends to enroll two groups of participants, each to be provided with informed consent before undergoing randomization into either the experimental or control group. The experimental group will undergo a digital rehabilitation program utilizing computer vision and augmented reality (AR) technology following their surgical procedure, while the control group will receive conventional care, involving in-clinic physical therapy sessions weekly. Both groups will adhere to a standardized rehabilitation protocol over a six-month duration. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at various intervals, including preoperatively, and at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks postoperatively. Imaging assessments and return-to-play evaluations will be conducted during the final follow-up. Clinical functionality will be assessed based on improvements in International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores.",

                    "The lack of access to physical therapists in developing countries and rural areas poses a significant challenge in supervising postsurgical rehabilitation, potentially impeding desirable outcomes following surgical interventions. For this reason, this study aims to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of utilizing a digital rehabilitation program based on computer vision and augmented reality in comparison with traditional care for patients who will undergo isolated meniscus repair, since to date, there is no literature on this topic.",
                    "This study intends to enroll two groups of participants, each to be provided with informed consent before undergoing randomization into either the experimental or control group. The experimental group will undergo a digital rehabilitation program utilizing computer vision and augmented reality (AR) technology following their surgical procedure, while the control group will receive conventional care, involving in-clinic physical therapy sessions weekly. Both groups will adhere to a standardized rehabilitation protocol over a six-month duration. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at various intervals, including preoperatively, and at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks postoperatively. Imaging assessments and return-to-play evaluations will be conducted during the final follow-up. Clinical functionality will be assessed based on improvements in International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores.",

For this reason, this study aims to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of utilizing a digital rehabilitation program based on computer vision and augmented reality in comparison with traditional care for patients who will undergo isolated meniscus repair, since to date, there is no literature on this topic.<h4>Methods</h4>This study intends to enroll two groups of participants, each to be provided with informed consent before undergoing randomization into either the experimental or control group. The experimental group will undergo a digital rehabilitation program utilizing computer vision and augmented reality (AR) technology following their surgical procedure, while the control group will receive conventional care, involving in-clinic physical therapy sessions weekly. Both groups will adhere to a standardized rehabilitation protocol over a six-month duration. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at various intervals, including preoperatively, and at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks postoperatively. Imaging assessments and return-to-play evaluations will be conducted during the final follow-up. Clinical functionality will be assessed based on improvements in International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores.<h4>Registration number</h4>ChiCTR2300070582.",

Methods This study intends to enroll two groups of participants, each to be provided with informed consent before undergoing randomization into either the experimental or control group. The experimental group will undergo a digital rehabilitation program utilizing computer vision and augmented reality (AR) technology following their surgical procedure, while the control group will receive conventional care, involving in-clinic physical therapy sessions weekly. Both groups will adhere to a standardized rehabilitation protocol over a six-month duration. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at various intervals, including preoperatively, and at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks postoperatively.

Format: \"Finding 1: [statistical data + meaning]. Finding 2: [data + context]\". Include ALL significant findings, p-values, effect sizes, accuracy rates, comparative data, accuracy measurements (sub-mm, degrees), specific understanding domains (surgical risks, operative steps, recovery), and detailed performance metrics beyond statistical significance. Present ALL questionnaire results, prototype performance, qualitative benefits. Include ALL cost factors, training requirements, implementation details. Capture ALL comparison groups and their specific results. Be comprehensive - capture complete findings picture. Include ALL technical specifications mentioned: accuracy measurements (sub-mm, degrees).\n\n7. *limitations*: Extract ALL limitations from limitation/discussion sections. Include sample size issues, technical equipment requirements, methodological, practical constraints. Mention ALL equipment needs, calibration requirements, manufacturing variability.
