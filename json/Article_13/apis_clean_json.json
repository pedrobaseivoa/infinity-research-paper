    "Abstract": "Background: Falls have high socioeconomic costs. Information and communication technologies may support provision and monitoring of multisensory (MSR) physiotherapy programmes. The HOLOBalance platform used augmented reality holograms to provide patient-centred, individualised MSR. Objectives: To determine the platform's safety, acceptability and feasibility, investigate functional gait and dynamic balance benefits and provide data for a definitive trial. Design and setting: Single-blinded pilot randomised controlled feasibility study. Interventions were conducted at clinical sites or participants' homes in three European countries. Participants: Community-dwelling older adults (median age 73 years; 64.2% female) at risk of falls were enrolled (May 2020-August 2021). Methods: Participants were randomised to an 8-week clinic or home-based telerehabilitation MSR or OTAGO (control group) programme. Compliance, satisfaction, and adverse events determined feasibility. Clinical outcomes, assessed (blinded) within one-week prior to and post-intervention, included functional gait assessment (FGA), Mini BESTest and cognitive function. Results: Randomisation to completion rate was 76.15% with 109 participants recruited (n = 289 screened). Drop-out rate was similar between groups. Adverse events were reported (n = 3) in the control group. Sixty-nine percent would recommend the HOLOBalance intervention. Findings were similar for the home and clinic-based arms of each intervention; data was combined for analysis. FGA (95%CI [1.63, 4.19]) and Mini-BESTest (95%CI [1.46, 3.93]) showed greater improvement in the HOLOBalance group with a clinically meaningful change of 4/30 noted for the FGA. Conclusions: HOLOBalance was feasible to implement and acceptable to older adults at risk of falls, with FGA and Mini-BEST improvements exceeding those for the OTAGO programme. A definitive trial is warranted.",
