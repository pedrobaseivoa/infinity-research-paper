    "Abstract": "Augmented-reality (AR) devices allow physicians to incorporate data visualization into diagnostic and treatment procedures to improve work efficiency and safety and reduce cost. They are also used to enhance surgical training. In this study, we implemented an AR application for Botox injections using a face recognition algorithm based on deep learning, and we evaluated the recognition accuracy of this application using 27 participants. The accuracy was around 3 mm for all parts of the facial region. The method of increasing surgical efficiency with AR is accurate enough to be used for surgery and provides great potential for further development.",
