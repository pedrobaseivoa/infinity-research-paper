Figure 6. Complete API Specialization Matrix

Comprehensive analysis of API contribution patterns across 16 metadata fields for 19 articles. Of 304 theoretically possible field combinations, 273 were successfully populated by the 11-API ecosystem. Vision emerged as the primary contributor (159 instances, 58.2% of total contributions), followed by Europe_Pmc (138 instances) and Crossref (124 instances). Data validation patterns: 62.6% of populated fields achieved multi-source validation, 26.7% relied on single-source extraction, and 10.6% utilized complementary data merging. API specializations: Vision excelled in core bibliographic fields (100% success for title, authors, abstract), while specialized APIs demonstrated domain expertiseâ€”Europe PMC for PubMed identifiers (100.0% PMID coverage), CrossRef for DOI validation (94.7% coverage), and Semantic Scholar for citation metrics (78.9% coverage). Cross-validation robustness: Critical fields showed extensive collaboration, with Authors (100.0% multi-source), DOI (94.7%), and Publisher (88.9%) achieving the highest validation rates across the API ecosystem.
