üü° CATEGORY E (Conceptually Different)
------------------------------------------------------------

ü§ñ Claude-only (6 instances):
  ‚Ä¢ Article 14 - Methodology
    Description: E
    Explanation: Both describe HoloLens 2 systems but focus on different applications - Infinity focuses on telepresence while manual focuses on ultrasound guidance
    Full classification: E

Resolution: Infinity CORRECT - perfectly captured telepresence methodology
Manual INCORRECT - study is not about ultrasound

  ‚Ä¢ Article 11 - Limitations
    Description: E
    Explanation: Manual focuses on equipment needs while automated focuses on methodological limitations - different aspects of study limitations
    Full classification: E

Resolution: Infinity CORRECT - precisely captured official methodological limitations

‚ö´ CATEGORY F (Incomparable)
------------------------------------------------------------

ü§ñ Claude-only (1 instance):
  ‚Ä¢ Article 10 - Limitations
    Description: F
    Explanation: Manual extraction shows 'Not evaluated' while automated provides detailed limitations - fields cannot be meaningfully compared
    Full classification: F

Resolution: Infinity made valid inferences about potential limitations based on study design, while manual was more conservative by not extracting limitations from a protocol. Both approaches are defensible, resulting in F (incomparable) classification - both correct.

ü§ù Both models agree (4 instances):
  ‚Ä¢ Article 9 - Limitations
    Claude: F
    Claude explanation: Manual extraction is marked as 'Not Evaluated', making comparison impossible
    DeepSeek: F
    DeepSeek explanation: Manual extraction not evaluated, no data to compare

Resolution: Infinity made valid inferences vs. manual conservative approach - but this is a study protocol which would be more related, so let's consider partially correct, manual correct, but study protocol - insights about this

  ‚Ä¢ Article 9 - Key_Findings
    Claude: F
    Claude explanation: Manual extraction shows 'Not applicable' while automated extraction provides specific IKDC and PASS threshold findings - cannot compare
    DeepSeek: F
    DeepSeek explanation: Manual extraction is 'Not applicable', making it incomparable with automated extraction.

Resolution: Manual correct - protocols fundamentally don't have "findings"; Infinity confused evaluation criteria with findings - but study protocol here gives insights for future consideration of study protocols and description of this protocol study issue

  ‚Ä¢ Article 10 - Key_Findings
    Claude: F
    Claude explanation: Manual extraction shows 'Not applicable' while automated has detailed findings - these are not meaningfully comparable
    DeepSeek: F
    DeepSeek explanation: Manual extraction is not applicable, making comparison impossible.

Resolution: Manual is correct - study protocols fundamentally don't have "Key Findings" in the sense of research results. They describe methodology for future findings. Infinity confused objectives/hypotheses/planned outcomes with actual findings, appropriately resulting in F (incomparable) classification - Manual correct, Infinity incorrect - but this gives insights for future consideration of study protocols

  ‚Ä¢ Article 17 - Key_Findings
    Claude: F
    Claude explanation: Manual extraction shows 'Not Applicable' while automated extraction provides detailed findings - cannot make meaningful comparison
    DeepSeek: F
    DeepSeek explanation: Manual extraction is 'Not Applicable', making it incomparable with automated extraction.

Resolution: These are PLANNED OUTCOMES and ASSESSMENT METHODS that will be used in the future study, not actual findings. The text uses future language: "will be explored", "is expressed in".
Verdict: Manual is correct - study protocols fundamentally don't have "Key Findings" in the sense of research results. They describe how to find future findings. Infinity confused planned outcome measures and assessment methods with actual findings, appropriately resulting in F (incomparable) classification.
