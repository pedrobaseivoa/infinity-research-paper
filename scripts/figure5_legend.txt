Figure 5. Vision Baseline vs API-Enhanced Consensus Performance - Core Bibliographic Fields (19 articles). Vision baseline: 87.1% (182/209 fields). Final consensus: 94.3% (197/209 fields). Overall improvement: +7.2% (+15 fields). Enhanced fields: 6/11 core fields. API enrichment successfully filled 15 additional bibliographic fields across 19 articles, demonstrating the complementary value of automated metadata enhancement over Vision-only baseline extraction. Fields with highest improvement: Pages (+21.1%), Journal (+15.8%), Year (+15.8%).
